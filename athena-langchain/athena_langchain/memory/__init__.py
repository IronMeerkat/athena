"""
Package for memory backends.

This package is intended to contain modules that interface with
persistent memory sources such as vector databases, relational
databases or file systems.  Define classes or functions here that
LangChain agents can use to store and retrieve documents.  Separate
your memory namespaces into collections (e.g. per‑user, per‑role) to
enforce access control.
