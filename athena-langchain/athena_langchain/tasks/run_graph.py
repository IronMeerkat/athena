"""
Celery task for executing LangChain graphs.

This module defines the ``run_graph`` task which is responsible for
selecting the correct agent/graph based on the provided manifest and
invoking it with the supplied input.  In this boilerplate the task
doesn't actually run any LangChain components; instead it logs the
inputs and returns a placeholder result.  Implement your own logic
here to instantiate and run LangChain graphs.
