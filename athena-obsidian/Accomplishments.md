- Pages created with shared patterns: popup, options, new-tab, side-panel, devtools, content, content-ui, content-runtime
- Shared packages established:
  - `@extension/contracts` for types and schemas
  - `@extension/agent-kit` for agent interfaces/registry
  - `@extension/llm` provider abstraction
  - `@extension/api-client` foundations
  - `@extension/shared`, `@extension/ui`, `@extension/i18n`, `@extension/storage`
  - Tooling: `hmr`, `vite-config`, `zipper`, `tailwindcss-config`
- Build/dev scripts unified across workspaces
- Project READMEs written across root, core, pages, and packages
- Plans drafted: agentic architecture, backlog, and non‑LLM ML roadmap
