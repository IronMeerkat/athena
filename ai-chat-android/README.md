**AI Chat Android** demonstrates [Google's Generative AI](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/leverage-generative-ai-in-your-android-apps.html) on Android with [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate below:

- Demonstrates [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart) for Android and handle the chunk stream responses as UI states.
- Implementing entire UI elements with Jetpack Compose.
- Implementation of Android architecture components with Jetpack libraries such as Hilt.
- Performing background tasks with Kotlin Coroutines.
- Integrating chat systems with [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) for handling real-time events.

## üíª How to build the project?

To build this project properly, you should follow the instructions below: 

1. Following the [Firebase setup guidelines](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), download the **google-services.json** and place it into the `app` directory on this project.

2. Next, create a file named `secrets.properties` in the root directory of this project, and copy & paste your Realtime Database URL into it, as shown in the example below:

![import](figures/db-url.png)

```
REALTIME_DATABASE_URL=..
```

3. Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)**, login with your Google account and select the **Get API key** on the menu left like the image below:

![gemini](figures/gemini0.png)

4. Create your API key for using generative AI SDKs, and you'll get one like the image below:

![gemini](figures/gemini1.png)

5. Add the key to the `secrets.properties` file like the below:

![gemini](figures/gemini2.png)

```gradle
GEMINI_API_KEY=..
REALTIME_DATABASE_URL=..
```

6. Build and run the project.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

**AI Chat Android** follows the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

![architecture](figures/figure0.png)

**AI Chat Android** was built with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.<br>

The overall architecture is composed of two layers; UI Layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they each have different responsibilities.
The arrow means the component has a dependency on the target component following its direction.

### Architecture Overview

![layer](figures/figure1.png)

Each layer has different responsibilities below. Basically, they follow [unidirectional event/data flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf).

### UI Layer

![layer](figures/figure2.png)

The UI Layer consists of UI elements like buttons, menus, tabs that could interact with users and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes.

### Data Layer

![layer](figures/figure3.png)

The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database and requesting remote data from the network. It is implemented as an offline-first source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) principle.<br>

## Modularization

![02](https://github.com/skydoves/gemini-android/assets/24237865/7b0cc635-83b0-434c-b151-d0e0e0a2ff9b)

**AI Chat Android** has implemented the following modularization strategies:

- **Reusability**: By effectively modularizing reusable code, it not only facilitates code sharing but also restricts code access across different modules.

- **Parallel Building**: Modules are capable of being built in parallel, leading to reduced overall build time.

- **Decentralized Focusing**: Individual development teams are allocated specific modules, allowing them to concentrate on their designated areas.
