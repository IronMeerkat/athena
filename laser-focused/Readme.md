## Modes

### Base Mode (âœ…)

Allows user to configure everything as they desire according to their own needs.

### Gamified Mode (ðŸš§ðŸ”¨)

This Mode introduces a gamified experience to control screen time using various fun elements like
quests and goals. This mode tracks your usage and configures everything accordingly as the days pass
by.
> [!CAUTION]
> This mode is being separately being developed as an individual app now. Checkout [QuestPhone](https://github.com/QuestPhone/questphone)

## Configuring

1. Launch DigiPaws on your Android device.
2. Provide all necessary permissions like Accessibility service, Notification, Draw over other apps etc
3. On Android 13+ devices, you need to additionally allow restricted settings before enabling the accessibility permission. Watch a tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/91B72lEpcqc?si=PCKKUSwM1aLdELqJ)
4. Configure the apps and views you want to block and set your preferences.
5. Start using your device with DigiPaws managing your screen time.


> [!TIP]  
> This app relies exclusively on accessibility services to function. Because it requires sensitive permissions, please avoid downloading it from untrusted sources.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3. Commit your changes.
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add some feature"
    ```
4. Push to the branch.
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5. Create a new Pull Request.

Please ensure your code adheres to our coding standards and includes relevant tests.

Developing codes for accessibility services and blockers can be exceptionally complex and challenging to understand. This is primarily because blocking mechanisms must account for various app types, each functioning differently. Discovering these mechanisms has often required extensive app-specific debugging, coupled with trial-and-error approaches.

## Common Questions

### Q: Is Digipaws safe?

**A:** Yes, way safer than any closed source app blocker on play-store.

### Q: Does it steal my data?

**A:** No. In fact it doesn't even need the INTERNET permission to run

### Q: I am unable to turn on accessibility settings. It says to enable "Restricted Settings"

**A:** Try downloading the app directly from f-droid app, instead of an .apk file. Read more on this
