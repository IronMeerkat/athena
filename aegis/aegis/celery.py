"""
Celery application for the Athena DRF project.

This module defines a Celery app instance which reads its configuration
from the Django settings.  It also autodiscovers tasks from all
installed Django apps so that you can define tasks in ``tasks.py`` files
throughout your project.  The Celery worker commands in the
dockerâ€‘compose file reference this module when starting workers.
