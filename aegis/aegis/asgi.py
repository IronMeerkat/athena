"""
ASGI config for Athena DRF project.

It exposes the ASGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.

This file wires up both HTTP handling (via Django's ``get_asgi_application``)
and WebSocket handling (via Channels).  WebSockets are routed through the
``api.routing.websocket_urlpatterns`` module.  You should extend that
module with your own consumers as you build realâ€‘time features.
