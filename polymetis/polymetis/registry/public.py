Public agent and tool registry.

This module defines a dictionary of agent identifiers to callable
constructors or graph objects that are safe to run in the public worker.
Only nonâ€‘sensitive agents and tools should be listed here.  The
registries are intentionally small in this boilerplate; add your own
entries as you build out your application.
